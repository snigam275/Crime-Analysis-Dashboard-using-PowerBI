# Crime-Analysis-Dashboard-using-PowerBI
Interactive Crime Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI to analyze crime trends, weapon involvement, victim demographics, and case clearance patterns using public crime data.
## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing large-scale crime data using Microsoft Power BI to identify meaningful patterns, trends, and insights related to crime occurrences. The dashboard provides an interactive and visual approach to understanding crime trends, weapon involvement, victim demographics, and case clearance performance over multiple years.

The objective of this project is to transform complex and raw crime datasets into actionable insights that can support data-driven decision-making for public safety analysis.
